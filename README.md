A growing collection of bite-sized Colab notebooks (aiming for 10-12 total) committed daily. Each covers one concept like Iris classification or linear regression, using beginner datasets.

## Day 1: Iris Classification
**Core concept:** Supervised learning with k-NN classifier.  
**What you'll do:** Load the classic Iris dataset (150 flowers, 4 measurements → 3 species), split train/test, train a model, evaluate accuracy, and visualize a confusion matrix.  
**Key takeaway:** See how simple ML pipelines work end-to-end, spot overfitting via experiments, and interpret results visually.
